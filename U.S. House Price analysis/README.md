This project is a comprehensive house-price EDA and time-series analysis project with ARIMA Time-series-forecast model, which is based on Zillow "House_Price_Value" data

ARIMA, short for ‘Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average’ is actually a class of models that ‘explains’ a given time series based on its own past values, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that equation can be used to forecast future values.
